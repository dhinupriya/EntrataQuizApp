# AI-Powered Quiz Backend

A Spring Boot 3.x backend application that generates AI-powered quizzes using OpenAI's GPT models. Users can input a topic, and the system will generate 5 multiple-choice questions with explanations.

## System Architecture & Technical Decisions

This application follows a modern **microservices-inspired architecture** with a **Spring Boot backend** and **React frontend**, designed for scalability and maintainability. The backend employs a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns: Controllers handle HTTP requests, Services contain business logic, and JPA Repositories manage data persistence. **Spring Security** provides authentication with Basic Auth, while **H2 in-memory database** ensures rapid development and testing. The system integrates **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** for cost-effective quiz generation, enhanced by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using Wikipedia APIs to improve factual accuracy. Key technical decisions include using **WebClient** for reactive HTTP calls, **JaCoCo** for test coverage monitoring, and **Maven** for dependency management, resulting in a robust, testable, and scalable quiz platform.


## AI Tool Usage & Rationale

**OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** was selected as the primary AI engine for quiz generation due to its optimal balance of cost-effectiveness, response speed, and quality for educational content creation. The model excels at generating structured, multiple-choice questions with accurate explanations while maintaining consistency in formatting. To address potential hallucination issues common in large language models, the system implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** by integrating **Wikipedia APIs** that fetch relevant, factual content before quiz generation. This hybrid approach combines the creative question-generation capabilities of GPT-4o-mini with verified information from reliable sources, significantly improving factual accuracy for topics like science, history, and technology. The system includes intelligent topic filtering to determine when RAG enhancement would be beneficial, fallback mechanisms for API failures, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable quiz generation even when external services are unavailable.

## Production Deployment

### Switching to PostgreSQL

1. Update `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

2. Update `application.yml`:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/quizdb
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

### Environment Variables

Set these in production:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: Set to `prod`
- Database connection details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
2. **Port Conflicts**: Change port in `application.yml` if 8080 is occupied
3. **Memory Issues**: Increase JVM heap size for large quiz generation
4. **Java Version**: Use Java 17+ for optimal compatibility
5. **CORS Issues**: Frontend requests may need proper CORS configuration

### Recent Fixes

- **Text Formatting**: Fixed display of `\n` characters and escape sequences
- **Answer Mapping**: Corrected scoring logic for proper answer comparison
- **Explanation Display**: Cleaned up unwanted prefixes and emojis
- **CORS Support**: Added cross-origin support for frontend integration
